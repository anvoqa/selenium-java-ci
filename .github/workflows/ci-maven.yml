# This workflow will run tests on the repository whenever new code is pushed to the 'main' branch, or a pull request is created to 'main' branch
# The workflow will start by installing JDK 11 then installing the latest chrome browser
# Finally, it will trigger the test using maven command mvn -B clean test
